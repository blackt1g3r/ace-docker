serverComponentsVersion: 1
# reportExcludedComponents: true # Controls whether messages are written on integration server start-up indicating components are excluded. Default is true.

# Main embedded run-times
# JVM: false      # Do not create a JVM within the Integration Server
NodeJS: false   # Do not create NodeJS run-time within the Integration Server
CLR: false      # Do not create a .NET CLR run-time within the Integration Server
# Deploy: false   # Do not allow deployments to an optimized integration server.
                         # Servers are optimized against set content that determines which components are loaded at start-up. Therefore new content should not be deployed.
                         # However, Deploy can be enabled to update existing content successfully.
                         # If new/changed content is deployed that requires components that are unavailable these resources cannot be used until the server is re-optimized.
